            <h4><b>Rank:1</b></h4> 
            <p>In 2021-22: 47 goals, 15 assists. Won Champions League, La Liga, UEFA Nations League & Supercopa de Espana.

                Was there ever any doubt? In terms of consistency through the season, number of top-level performances, standing up in the biggest moments possible and final trophy haul, Benzema ticks every box needed to win a Ballon d'Or.
                
                There is not a player who even comes close to the Real Madrid striker in terms of impact on the 2021-22 European season, and he will rightfully lift the Golden Ball at October's ceremony.
                
                Anyone who does not vote for him better have a good reason why!</p>

            <h4><b>Rank:2</b></h4> 
            <p>Won 2 Trophies this week and was the key player on Liverpool team.There was considerable doubt over whether Van Dijk would return the same player after the knee injury which wrecked his 2020-21 campaign.

              However, after an understandably sluggish start to the season, the Netherlands international got back to his brilliant best, playing a pivotal role in Liverpool coming desperately close to pulling off a historic quadruple.
              
              He just makes it all so easy that when Michael Owen says he can't think of a better centre-back from the past 40 years, we struggle to disagree...</p>

              <h4><b>Rank:3</b></h4> 
              <p>Impact Vinicius scored the winning goal for his first Champions League title, capping off a stunning breakout campaign for the 21-year-old. He tallied 17 goals and 10 assists in La Liga, finishing third place in the league in both categories, as well as four goals and six assists in the UCL. Karim Benzema is also in the form of his life at the moment, but he will turn 35 next season so Vinicius really looks like the future of this club.</p>
