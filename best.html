            <div class="content">
               <h3>10.Ajax</h3>
               <span>Ajax may fall short of their former glory, but a sparkle has returned to Amsterdam in recent years.</span>
            </div>
         </div>

         <div class="swiper-slide slide" style="background: url(img/man-united.png) no-repeat;">
            <div class="content">
               <h3>9.Manchester United</h3>
               <span>Manchester United are arguably the most contentious team in this list, but those with memories longer than a few months will appreciate that United aren't a finished entity.</span>
            </div>
         </div>

         <div class="swiper-slide slide" style="background: url(img/juve.png) no-repeat;">
            <div class="content">
               <h3>8.Juventus</h3>
               <span>A historic giant with total dominance in Italy for the last decade, Juventus have wavered during the COVID pandemic times.</span>

         <div class="swiper-slide slide" style="background: url(img/inter.png) no-repeat;">
            <div class="content">
               <h3>7.Inter</h3>
               <span> Antonio Conte and Romelu Lukaku's departures threatened to derail Inter no sooner than they had finally returned to the summit of Italian football. Reports of their demise have been proven to be greatly exaggerated.</span>

            <div class="content">
               <h3>6.Real Madrid</h3>
               <span> Carlo Ancelotti's men remain a predictable force in Spain and on the continent at a time when their fierce rivals Barcelona have vanished from relevance.
                Karim Benzema, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric still form the spine of the team as they sit top of La Liga and their Champions League group.</span>

               <h3>5.Chelsea</h3>
               <span> The reigning Champions League winners simply have to be this high up on the list. It's the hardest club competition to win, but they did it, and tamed beasts along the way.Thomas Tuchel's side know how to dig in and grind out results in knockout ties. It's why they won Europe's top honour, it's why they do well in domestic cups.</span>

         <div class="swiper-slide slide" style="background: url(img/psg.png) no-repeat;">
            <div class="content">
               <h3>4.Psg</h3>
               <span>Many won't like to hear it, they won't like to acknowledge it, but PSG are a big fish in the European pond now.Their form has been average in Ligue 1 and the Champions League alike, they've done enough without going above and beyond, but defeating Manchester City this season was a massive show of force.</span>
            </div>

               <h3>3.Liverpool</h3>
               <span>It hasn't been a 'clean' season for Liverpool so far, but they boast the hottest player in world football right now among their attacking forces.</span>

            <div class="content">
               <h3>1.Manchester City</h3>
               <span>It feels as though the top three on this list are in a league of their own and will take several years to dislodge. You could trim Liverpool away and leave Bayern and City at the top based on sheer tangible trophies.</span>
